# Canteen-Ordering-System
Unilever is a British-Dutch MNC FMCG company, headquartered in London, England. Unilever is one of the oldest FMCG companies, and its products are available in around 190 countries. In its UK offices, Unilever had around 1500 employees which were spread across 12 floors. They had 2 canteens to cater to these 1500 employees. Each canteen could seat around 150 employees at a time. 

Most employees would prefer to take their lunch between 12 noon to 1 pm. This led to a huge rush in the canteen during lunch hours resulting in employees wasting a lot of time waiting for tables to be vacant. 

Management calculated that it took around 60 minutes for employees to go and come back from lunch. Almost 30-35 minutes were wasted in waiting in a queue to collect their food and get a table to sit and eat. However, the time spent eating was barely 10-15 minutes. The remaining 10 minutes were spent reaching and coming back from the canteen using the elevators. 

Employees donâ€™t always get their choice of food they want because the canteen runs out of certain items. The canteen wastes a significant quantity of food by throwing away what is not purchased.

Many employees have requested a system that would permit a canteen user to order meals online, to be delivered to their work location at a specified time and date.
